# JavaScript OOPS (Object Oriented Programming)

This folder covers Object Oriented Programming concepts in JavaScript with
clear theory and practical examples.

## OOPS Fundamentals
Object Oriented Programming helps in writing clean, reusable, and scalable code
by organizing logic into objects and classes.

### Core OOPS Concepts
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

## Topics Covered

### 1. Object & Method
Objects store data and methods are functions inside objects.

### 2. this Keyword
`this` refers to the object that is calling the method.

### 3. Prototype
JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance where objects can inherit properties
from other objects.

### 4. Inheritance
One object can access properties and methods of another object.

### 5. Encapsulation
Wrapping data and methods inside a single unit and restricting direct access.

### 6. Polymorphism
Same method name behaves differently based on context.

### 7. Abstraction
Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
