# JavaScript Functions Practice

This repository contains my JavaScript practice focused on **functions and execution flow**.
I am learning Full Stack Development and regularly updating this repository with core JavaScript concepts.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Function Declaration
- Parameters and Arguments
- Return Statement
- Default Parameters
- Template Literals
- Function Expression
- Call Stack & Function Execution Order

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How functions are defined and invoked in JavaScript
- Difference between `console.log()` and `return`
- How default parameters work
- Understanding function expressions
- How JavaScript executes functions using the call stack

## Hoisting in JavaScript (Functions)

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope
during the memory creation phase.

### Function Declaration (Hoisted)
Function declarations are fully hoisted, so they can be called before definition.

### Function Expression & Arrow Function (Not Hoisted)
Function expressions and arrow functions behave like variables and cannot be
called before initialization.
