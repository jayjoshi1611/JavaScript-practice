# Advanced JavaScript OOPS Concepts

This folder focuses on advanced Object Oriented JavaScript concepts related to
`this` keyword, function binding, and asynchronous behavior.

These concepts are commonly asked in JavaScript interviews.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. this Keyword
Understanding how `this` behaves in different contexts.

### 2. setTimeout & this
How `this` behaves inside asynchronous functions.

### 3. call()
Used to invoke a function with a specific `this` value.

### 4. apply()
Same as call but arguments are passed as an array.

### 5. bind()
Returns a new function with permanently bound `this`.

## What I Learned
- How `this` changes based on execution context
- Difference between call, apply, and bind
- Why `bind()` is useful in callbacks and async code
